A fifth sense belt for visually impaired people which helps them avoid obstacles while moving by providing them with haptic feedback. Used Depth Stream by Kinectâ€™s NUISensor to do a semantic segmentation for obstacles in front of the user. Used Vibrating motors(LMR) for haptic feedback and Rpi for processing and IO.
